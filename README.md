## AI-Driven Avatars in Immersive Virtual Environments: Workflow and Case Study of the Temple of Demeter, Greece
I have developed workflows for designing sustainable immersive learning experiences that incorporate realistic scenarios and natural interaction with AI avatars. This project created point cloud digital 3D models from photogrammetry and incorporated these into Unreal Engine 5. I then integrated generative AI avatars into the environment, enabling natural language interaction between users and an AI tutor. The integration facilitates interactive participation and enables high-precision digital reproduction of the physical environment. The proposed workflow is presented via a case study for a virtual study abroad experience in Naxos, Greece, using an AI-driven tutor to educate about the historical aspects of the island. This project provides the beneficial learning experience of study abroad experiences without the economic and environmental costs of sending students on field excursions.

## The concept of the developed workflow for AI-driven immersive learning
