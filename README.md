## AI-Driven Avatars in Immersive Virtual Environments: Workflow and Case Study of the Temple of Demeter, Greece
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are changing education and offer new opportunities for how people interact with environments. Technological advances over the past few decades have lowered barriers to creating virtual environments; however, there are still challenges, particularly when creating realistic virtual environments of real places. Realism is important as the fidelity of virtual environments influences user experience. In addition, methods and techniques that can facilitate ease of interacting with these environments are needed to streamline the user experience. One promising way to do this is incorporating AI-driven avatars into realistic scenes, allowing users to use natural languing immersive learning experiences focused on sustainability education that incorporate realistic scage to interact with and learn about the landscapes. To this end, we have developed workflows for designenarios and natural interaction with AI avatars. This study created point cloud digital 3D models from photogrammetry and incorporated these into Unreal Engine 5. We then integrated generative AI avatars into the environment, enabling natural language interaction between users and an AI tutor. The integration facilitates interactive participation and enables high-precision digital reproduction of the physical environment. The novel proposed workflow is presented via a case study for a virtual study abroad experience in Naxos, Greece, using an AI-driven tutor to educate about the historical aspects of the island. This project provides the beneficial learning experience of study abroad experiences without the economic and environmental costs of sending students on field excursions. We recommend constructing immersive education experiences using real-world environments and natural AI-driven conversations and demonstrating its potential to revolutionize social interaction, historical heritage preservation, and sustainable pedagogy.
