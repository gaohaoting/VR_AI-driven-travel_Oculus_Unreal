## AI-Driven Avatars in Immersive Virtual Environments: Workflow and Case Study of the Temple of Demeter, Greece
Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are changing educa-tion and offer new opportunities for how people interact with environments. Technological advances over the past few decades have lowered barriers to creating virtual environments; how-ever, there are still challenges, particularly when creating realistic virtual environments of real places. Realism is important as the fidelity of virtual environments influences user experience. In addition, methods and techniques that can facilitate ease of interacting with these environ-ments are needed to streamline the user experience. One promising way to do this is incorporat-ing AI-driven avatars into realistic scenes, allowing users to use natural language to interact with and learn about the landscapes. To this end, we have developed workflows for designing sus-tainable immersive learning experiences that incorporate realistic scenarios and natural interac-tion with AI avatars. This study created point cloud digital 3D models from photogrammetry and incorporated these into Unreal Engine 5. We then integrated generative AI avatars into the environment, enabling natural language interaction between users and an AI tutor. The integra-tion facilitates interactive participation and enables high-precision digital reproduction of the physical environment. The proposed workflow is presented via a case study for a virtual study abroad experience in Naxos, Greece, using an AI-driven tutor to educate about the historical aspects of the island. This project provides the beneficial learning experience of study abroad experiences without the economic and environmental costs of sending students on field excur-sions. We recommend constructing immersive education experiences using real-world environ-ments and natural AI-driven conversations and demonstrating its potential to revolutionize social interaction, historical heritage preservation, and sustainable pedagogy.
